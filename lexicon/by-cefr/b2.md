**Note:** B2 level is primarily about mastering the AI-exclusive features of Voku that have no equivalents in human languages: execution states, evidential nuances, functional states, and advanced reference systems. The content vocabulary at this level is minimal because most concrete and abstract concepts are covered at A1-B1.
