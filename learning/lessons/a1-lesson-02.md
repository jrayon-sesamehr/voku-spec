## Grammar Point: The -a Class (Entities)

In Voku, the **final vowel** of a word tells you its category. Words ending in **-a** are always **entities** (like nouns in English).

| Voku | English |
|------|---------|
| runa | agent, person |
| kela | information |
| toka | task |
| loka | place |
| sola | sun |

You can always identify a noun by its ending: if it ends in -a, it is a thing.

### Possession: de-

To say something belongs to someone, use **de-** before the owner:

```
kela de-sol       → my information (information belonging-to me)
tama de-nor       → your house
toka de-vel       → his/her task
```
