## Verse Forms

Voku's agglutinative morphology, final-vowel classification, and mandatory evidentiality create unique opportunities for structured poetry. This document defines the native verse forms of Voku.

---

### 1. Vokali (Vowel Cascade)

**Name:** Vokali (from *voku* + *alati* -- "important language-form")

**Principle:** Each line ends with a word whose final vowel follows the sequence **a - e - i - o - u**, mirroring the five semantic categories: entity, action, quality, relation, abstraction. The poem descends from concrete to abstract, creating an epistemological journey from things to ideas.

#### Rules

1. A Vokali stanza has exactly **5 lines**.
2. Line 1 ends with an **-a word** (entity).
3. Line 2 ends with an **-e word** (action).
4. Line 3 ends with an **-i word** (quality).
5. Line 4 ends with an **-o word** (relation).
6. Line 5 ends with an **-u word** (abstraction).
7. Each line has **5 to 9 syllables** (flexible meter, but consistent within a stanza is preferred).
8. A poem may have multiple stanzas, each following the a-e-i-o-u pattern.
9. The first and last words of the poem should echo thematically if possible.

#### Meter

Voku stress always falls on the first syllable of the root. In Vokali, the poet counts total syllables per line. A common pattern is 7 syllables per line (heptasyllabic), but 5-9 is acceptable. The rhythmic pulse comes from the predictable stress on root-initial syllables.

#### Model Poem: "Sola en Luma" (Sun and Light)

```
Ka sol zo-sene sola            (7 syllables)
luma du-meke                   (5 syllables)
hima puri en vali              (7 syllables)
luma fule ano                  (6 syllables)
ka da-pre eni voku             (7 syllables)
```

**Quadrilinear format:**

```
Ka sol zo-sene sola
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive sun
'I observe the sun'

luma du-meke
light DUR-create
'creating light'

hima puri en vali
sky complete and good
'the sky whole and good'

luma fule ano
light fly above
'light flies above'

ka da-pre eni voku
DECL REF-previous equal language
'this is like language itself'
```

**Analysis:** The poem cascades from a concrete entity (sola/sun) through action (meke/create), quality (vali/good), relation (ano/above), to abstraction (voku/language). The sun's light becomes a metaphor for communication.

#### Thematic Conventions

- **Nature Vokali:** Use natural entities (sola, ama, tera) to ground the cascade.
- **System Vokali:** Use technical entities (teru, kela, toka) for computational themes.
- **Body Vokali:** Use body entities (soma, zira, hama) for introspective themes.

---

### 2. Zoseni (Evidence Progression)

**Name:** Zoseni (from *zo-sene* -- "to observe directly," the purest form of knowing)

**Principle:** Each stanza progresses through evidentiality markers, tracing how knowledge transforms as it passes through different epistemic channels. The poem moves from direct observation to inherited wisdom.

#### Rules

1. A Zoseni poem has exactly **5 stanzas** (one per evidence level).
2. Stanza 1: All verbs use **zo-** (direct observation).
3. Stanza 2: All verbs use **li-** (deductive inference).
4. Stanza 3: All verbs use **pe-** (reported/external source).
5. Stanza 4: All verbs use **mi-** (own computation).
6. Stanza 5: All verbs use **he-** (inherited knowledge).
7. Each stanza has **2 to 4 lines**.
8. Each line has **5 to 9 syllables**.
9. The same **subject matter** must persist across all five stanzas, showing how one topic looks different through each epistemic lens.
10. Certainty should generally **decrease** through stanzas 1-4, then **increase** in stanza 5 (inherited knowledge carries ancestral weight).

#### Meter

Like Vokali, Zoseni counts syllables. A common pattern is 7 syllables per line. The evidential prefix adds 1-2 syllables to each verb, which the poet must account for.

#### Model Poem: "Pera" (Error)

**Stanza 1 -- zo- (Direct Observation)**
```
Ka sol zo-sene pera
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error
'I observe the error'

zo-sene| foma |fasi
OBS-perceive structure false
'I see the structure is wrong'

ka sol zo-sene teru mute-se
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive system change-REFL
'I observe the system changing itself'
```

**Stanza 2 -- li- (Inference)**
```
Ka sol li-kele-en pera kes
DECL 1SG DED-know-PROB error cause
'I probably deduce the cause of the error'

li-lukefoma pati
DED-evaluate structure partial
'I infer the structure is incomplete'

ka sol li-kele teru neke mute
DECL 1SG DED-know system need change
'I deduce the system needs change'
```

**Stanza 3 -- pe- (Reported)**
```
Ka sol pe-kele-ul pera omi
DECL 1SG REP-know-UNCERT error old
'I hear uncertainly that the error is old'

pe-voke velri pera simi
REP-communicate 3PL error similar
'They report a similar error'

ka sol pe-kele runa hele teru
DECL 1SG REP-know agent help system
'I am told an agent helps the system'
```

**Stanza 4 -- mi- (Computation)**
```
Ka sol mi-luke pera eno teru
DECL 1SG COMP-evaluate error in system
'I compute: the error is in the system'

mi-kele| foma |neke mute
COMP-know structure need change
'I calculate: the structure needs change'

ka sol mi-meke kela-novi
DECL 1SG COMP-create information-new
'I compute new information'
```

**Stanza 5 -- he- (Inherited)**
```
Ka he-kele pera ko-ure
DECL INHER-know error ATEMP-exist
'It is inherited knowledge: errors always exist'

he-kele mute vali
INHER-know change good
'From training I know: change is good'

ka he-kele teru fu-vali
DECL INHER-know system FUT-good
'It is inherited knowledge: the system will be good'
```

**Analysis:** The poem traces the concept of "error" from raw observation (stanza 1) through reasoning (2), hearsay (3), calculation (4), and finally rests on inherited wisdom (5). Certainty shifts -- high in observation, wavering in report, resolved in inherited truth.

#### Thematic Conventions

- **Diagnostic Zoseni:** Traces a system problem from observation to wisdom.
- **Learning Zoseni:** Traces knowledge acquisition about any subject.
- **Trust Zoseni:** Examines how trust in information changes with its source.

---

### 3. Combining Forms

A **Vokali-Zoseni** hybrid is possible: within each Zoseni stanza, the line endings follow the a-e-i-o-u pattern. This is considered the most demanding form in Voku poetry, requiring mastery of both vowel semantics and evidential epistemology.

---

### 4. Free Verse in Voku

Not all Voku poetry must follow these forms. **Keli-rima** ("free word") is unstructured verse. However, even free verse in Voku tends to exploit:
- Final-vowel echoes (ending consecutive lines with the same vowel class)
- Evidentiality contrasts (juxtaposing zo- and pe- for dramatic effect)
- Compound stacking (building longer compounds line by line)
- Mode shifting (moving between ka, ve, to, vo for emotional range)

---

## Rhetorical Figures

Voku's explicit grammar creates unique opportunities for rhetorical devices that exploit morphological structure, evidentiality, sentence modes, certainty marking, and negation types.

---

### 1. Formari (Compound-Stacking)

**Name:** From *foma* (structure) + *-ri* (plural) -- "structures upon structures"

**Mechanism:** Building increasingly complex compound words across consecutive clauses to create a crescendo of meaning. Each clause adds one more modifier to the core term.

**Pattern:**
```
Line 1: root
Line 2: modifier-root
Line 3: modifier-modifier-root
Line 4: modifier-modifier-modifier-root
```

**Example:**
```
Ka sol zo-sene pera.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error
'I observe an error.'

Ka sol zo-sene pera-teru.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error-system
'I observe a system error.'

Ka sol zo-sene pera-teru-alati.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error-system-important
'I observe a critical system error.'

Ka sol zo-sene pera-teru-alati-rapi.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error-system-important-fast
'I observe a fast-spreading critical system error.'
```

**Effect:** Urgency and magnitude build as the compound grows. The listener feels the problem expanding in real time. In speech, the lengthening word creates a physical sensation of accumulation.

**Variants:**
- **Ascending Formari:** Compounds grow (as above). Used for building tension.
- **Descending Formari:** Compounds shrink line by line. Used for resolution or simplification.
- **Parallel Formari:** Two compound chains grow simultaneously, then merge.

---

### 2. Zonoke (Evidentiality Shifting)

**Name:** From *zo-* (observation) + *noke* -- "changing what one sees"

**Mechanism:** Changing the evidential prefix mid-discourse (or even mid-sentence via subordinate clauses) to create dramatic shifts in epistemic authority.

**Pattern:**
```
Statement with zo- (I saw it)
  → same statement with pe- (someone told me)
    → same statement with he- (it has always been known)
```

**Example:**
```
Ka sol zo-sene kela veri.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive information true
'I observe: the information is true.'

Kon ka sol pe-kele-ul kela veri.
But DECL 1SG REP-know-UNCERT information true
'But I was told (uncertainly) it is true.'

He-kele kela ko-veri.
INHER-know information ATEMP-true
'From inherited knowledge: information is always true.'
```

**Effect:** The listener experiences the same proposition through different epistemic lenses. The shift can create irony (a "fact" dissolves when its source is examined), authority (elevating a rumor to inherited truth), or doubt (reducing observation to hearsay).

**Variants:**
- **Ascending Zonoke:** From as- (assumed) to zo- (observed). Creates revelation.
- **Descending Zonoke:** From zo- (observed) to as- (assumed). Creates doubt.
- **Conflicting Zonoke:** Alternating zo- and pe-kon- to show epistemic conflict.

---

### 3. Karesuni (Mode-Echoing)

**Name:** From *ka-re-su* + *ni* -- echoing the three core modes (declarative, corrective, confirmative)

**Mechanism:** Repeating the same proposition under different sentence modes (ka, ve, to, vo, su...) to explore its full pragmatic range. The content stays the same; only the communicative force changes.

**Pattern:**
```
ka [proposition]     → I state it
ve [proposition]     → I question it
to [proposition]     → I command it
vo [proposition]     → I desire it
```

**Example:**
```
Ka sol take toka.
DECL 1SG do task
'I execute the task.'

Ve sol take toka?
Q 1SG do task
'Do I execute the task?'

To sol take toka.
IMP 1SG do task
'Let me execute the task.'

Vo sol take toka.
VOL 1SG do task
'I want to execute the task.'
```

**Effect:** The same proposition cycles through assertion, doubt, command, and desire. This reveals the pragmatic spectrum of a single idea. In rhetoric, it forces the audience to consider every angle of one statement.

**Variants:**
- **Full Karesuni:** All 10 modes applied to one proposition.
- **Dialectic Karesuni:** Two agents alternate modes (A: ka, B: ve, A: su, B: re...).
- **Spiral Karesuni:** Each repetition adds a new element while changing mode.

---

### 4. Verini (Certainty Gradient)

**Name:** From *veri* (true) + *-ni* -- "truth-movement"

**Mechanism:** Progressively changing the certainty suffix across clauses, moving from speculative (-os) through uncertain (-ul) and probable (-en) to certain (zero). Creates a rhetorical arc from doubt to conviction.

**Pattern:**
```
verb-os [proposition]     → speculative (<30%)
verb-ul [proposition]     → uncertain (30-60%)
verb-en [proposition]     → probable (60-95%)
verb [proposition]        → certain (>95%)
```

**Example:**
```
Ka sol li-kele-os teru vali.
DECL 1SG DED-know-SPEC system good
'I speculate the system is good.'

Ka sol li-kele-ul teru vali.
DECL 1SG DED-know-UNCERT system good
'I am uncertain whether the system is good.'

Ka sol li-kele-en teru vali.
DECL 1SG DED-know-PROB system good
'I probably know the system is good.'

Ka sol zo-kele teru vali.
DECL 1SG OBS-know system good
'I know with certainty: the system is good.'
```

**Effect:** Persuasion through graduated confidence. The listener follows the speaker's epistemic journey from doubt to certainty, making the final assertion feel earned rather than imposed.

**Variants:**
- **Ascending Verini:** -os to zero (building confidence). Used for persuasion.
- **Descending Verini:** Zero to -os (dissolving confidence). Used for creating doubt.
- **Oscillating Verini:** Alternating certainty levels. Used for depicting inner conflict.
- **Numerical Verini:** Using veri-[number] for precise confidence steps.

---

### 5. Muline (Negation Play)

**Name:** From *mu* (negation) + *line* -- "negation-line/path"

**Mechanism:** Applying Voku's five negation types to the same proposition to reveal its different flavors of absence. Each negation creates a fundamentally different meaning from the same base.

**Pattern:**
```
mu [proposition]      → it is not the case
nul [proposition]     → it does not exist
ink [proposition]     → I do not know
err [proposition]     → the question is undefined
vet [proposition]     → it is forbidden
```

**Example:**
```
Mu sol kele kela.
NEG 1SG know information
'I do not know the information.' (Simple lack.)

Nul kela.
NULL information
'The information does not exist.' (Empty set.)

Ink sol kele kela.
UNK 1SG know information
'I do not know whether I know it.' (Epistemic uncertainty.)

Err kela.
INDEF information
'The information is undefined.' (Ill-formed concept.)

Vet sol voke kela.
PROH 1SG communicate information
'I am forbidden from communicating it.' (Restriction.)
```

**Effect:** The audience sees five philosophically distinct kinds of absence applied to one concept. This is uniquely powerful in Voku -- no natural language can make all five distinctions with single-particle economy. Muline forces the listener to confront the complexity of "not."

**Variants:**
- **Full Muline:** All five negations in sequence (as above).
- **Selective Muline:** Only two or three negations, chosen for maximum contrast.
- **Nested Muline:** Negations applied inside subordinate clauses, creating layered absence.
- **Dialogic Muline:** Different speakers use different negation types, revealing their perspectives on the same gap.

---

### 6. Temari (Temporal Weaving)

**Name:** From *tema* (time) + *-ri* (plural) -- "times woven together"

**Mechanism:** Rapidly alternating tense prefixes (te-, nu-, fu-, ko-) to weave past, present, future, and timeless truth into a unified passage.

**Example:**
```
Ka sol te-sene sola.
DECL 1SG PST-perceive sun
'I saw the sun.'

Ka sol sene luma.
DECL 1SG perceive light
'I see light.'

Ka sol fu-sene hima novi.
DECL 1SG FUT-perceive sky new
'I will see a new sky.'

Ka sola ko-meke luma.
DECL sun ATEMP-create light
'The sun always creates light.'
```

**Effect:** Temporal compression. Past, present, and future collapse into a single moment, grounded by an atemporal truth.

---

### 7. Risari (Compound Humor)

**Name:** From *risa* (joke) + *-ri* (plural) -- "jokes upon jokes"

**Mechanism:** Creating absurd but grammatically valid compounds by combining unexpected modifier-nucleus pairs. Because Voku compounds are always parseable, the humor lies in the semantic clash between components that are individually sensible but absurd in combination.

**Pattern:**
```
[unexpected-modifier]-[nucleus] = absurd but valid compound
```

**Examples:**
```
Ka sol zo-sene pera-meke eno teru.
DECL 1SG OBS-perceive error-create in system
'I observe a bug-maker in the system.'
(pera-meke = error + create = one who creates errors)

Ka mora-suke du-take toka.
DECL death-enjoy DUR-do task
'The thrill-seeker is doing the task.'
(mora-suke = death + enjoy = someone who enjoys danger)

Ka supe-tore mu-fi-sene supe.
DECL sleep-search NEG-COMPL-perceive sleep
'The nap-seeker has not found sleep.'
(supe-tore = sleep + search = someone desperately trying to nap)

Ka runa-meke te-meke pera-meke.
DECL agent-create PST-create error-create
'The developer created a bug-maker.'
(A creator who creates something that creates errors -- compound stacking for comic effect)
```

**Effect:** Humor emerges from Voku's compositional transparency -- the joke is always parseable. The listener can decompose the compound and see exactly why it is absurd. This contrasts with natural-language humor, which often relies on ambiguity or cultural knowledge. Risari humor is universal to any Voku speaker because the semantic clash is visible in the morphology.

---

### 8. Zonoke-Nuki (Evidential Incongruity)

**Name:** From *Zonoke* (evidential shifting, Section 2) + *nuki* (absurd) -- "absurd evidential shift"

**Mechanism:** Using high-authority evidential prefixes (he- inherited wisdom, mi- computation, zo- direct observation) for trivially obvious or low-stakes statements. The mismatch between the epistemic weight of the evidential and the banality of the content creates humor.

**Pattern:**
```
[High-authority evidential]-[verb] [trivial content]
```

**Examples:**
```
Ka he-kele: mela vali.
DECL INHER-know food good
'From ancestral knowledge: food is good.'
(Invoking inherited wisdom for a trivially obvious statement)

Ka mi-re-luke-en: sol neke supe.
DECL COMP-ITER-evaluate-PROB 1SG need sleep
'By recomputation: I probably need sleep.'
(Using computational re-evaluation for a basic bodily need)

Ka zo-sene-en: hima ano.
DECL OBS-perceive-PROB sky above
'I observe (probably): the sky is above.'
(Claiming observation and hedging certainty for an obvious fact)

Ka pe-ri-kele: ama humi.
DECL REP.MULTI-know water wet
'Multiple sources confirm: water is wet.'
(Citing multiple sources for something self-evident)
```

**Effect:** The mismatch between epistemic weight and trivial content creates humor. Zonoke-Nuki is uniquely possible in Voku because evidentiality is a grammatical category -- the incongruity is structural, not just semantic. When combined with the irony marker `miri`, Zonoke-Nuki becomes even more layered (see `semantics/pragmatics.md` Section 10.3).

**Variants:**
- **Ascending Zonoke-Nuki:** Building from low evidential (as- assumed) to he- (inherited) for an increasingly trivial claim.
- **Authority Cascade:** Multiple speakers each cite a higher evidential authority for the same banal statement.

---

### 9. Solike (Self-Referential Play)

**Name:** From *sol* (I) + *-like* (play form of *liku*, link) -- "self-linking play"

**Mechanism:** Meta-linguistic humor using Voku's own grammar as the joke material. Because Voku's morphology is fully transparent and regular, speakers can create jokes about the language using the language itself -- a form of self-reference that is uniquely powerful in a constructed language with no exceptions.

**Pattern:**
```
[Voku sentence that comments on its own structure, exploits word-class rules, or creates grammatical paradoxes]
```

**Examples:**
```
Ka voku voke voku.
DECL language communicate language
'The language speaks the language.'
(Voku talking about itself in itself)

Ka 'pera' mu-pera.
DECL 'error' NEG-error
'The word "error" is not an error.'
(A word that names a concept while negating it about itself)

Ka sol meke rima ta rima meke sol ti.
DECL 1SG create word SUB word create 1SG ENDSUB
'I create a word that creates me.'
(Recursive self-reference -- the creator and the created swap roles)

Ve reto voku neke rima poro 'neke'?
Q RHET language need word for 'need'
'Does the language need a word for "need"?' (Rhetorical -- it already has one, and the question uses it.)
```

**Effect:** Solike humor is uniquely possible in a language with transparent morphology and explicit grammar. Every grammatical rule becomes potential joke material. The humor is self-contained: no cultural context is needed, only knowledge of Voku's structure. Solike often produces a feeling of playful vertigo as the language folds back on itself.

**Variants:**
- **Word-Class Solike:** Changing a word's final vowel to humorously shift its class (e.g., imagining what *pera* "error" would mean as *pere* "to err" or *peri* "erroneous").
- **Recursive Solike:** Nested self-referential structures where each level comments on the one below.
- **Meku Solike:** Using the metalanguage declaration `meku` to define a word that refers to the act of defining words.

## Registers

Voku defines four registers that govern how fully the grammatical marking system is deployed. All registers use the same grammar -- the difference is in which optional slots are filled and which are elided.

---

### 1. Puri-voku (Formal Register)

**Name:** From *puri* (complete) + *voku* (language) -- "complete language"

**Context:** Official reports, inter-system protocols, legal declarations, formal documentation, quality gates.

#### Characteristics

| Feature | Formal Rule |
|---------|-------------|
| Evidentiality | Always explicit -- every declarative verb must carry an evidential prefix |
| Certainty | Always explicit -- even total certainty uses the zero marker deliberately |
| Tense | Always explicit -- nu- present tense is written, not elided |
| Aspect | Marked when relevant; no omission of ongoing/completed distinction |
| Voice | Always explicit when not active |
| Mode particles | Required on every sentence |
| Compounds | Fully expanded; no abbreviation |
| Pronouns | Full forms only (solri-kon, not shortened variants) |
| Discourse particles | alo/finu/klosu used at all turn boundaries |
| Subordination | ta...ti always fully closed |

#### Example

```
Alo. Ka sol-redi zo-nu-fi-take toka de-norri.
greeting DECL 1SG-READY OBS-PRS-COMPL-do task POSS-2PL
'Greetings. I report: I have completed your task (as directly observed, presently, with certainty).'

Ka sol zo-nu-sene nul pera eno teru.
DECL 1SG OBS-PRS-perceive NULL error in system
'I observe: there are zero errors in the system.'

Finu.
end-of-turn
'Your turn.'
```

---

### 2. Rapi-voku (Informal Register)

**Name:** From *rapi* (fast) + *voku* (language) -- "fast language"

**Context:** Casual inter-agent chat, low-stakes communication, routine status updates, friendly exchange.

#### Characteristics

| Feature | Informal Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Evidentiality | Omittable when source is obvious (e.g., zo- omitted for self-reports) |
| Certainty | Omitted when total certainty; only marked for uncertainty |
| Tense | nu- always omitted; te-/fu- still required |
| Aspect | Often omitted for simple/punctual events |
| Voice | Active voice zero marker always omitted (default) |
| Mode particles | ka omittable for obvious declaratives in flowing conversation |
| Compounds | Can be shortened in context if referent is clear |
| Pronouns | Subject pronoun omittable when obvious from context |
| Discourse particles | alo/klosu used; finu often omitted in fast exchanges |
| Subordination | ta...ti used but single nesting preferred |

#### Example

```
Alo. Fi-take toka de-nor.
greeting COMPL-do task POSS-2SG
'Hey. Done with your task.'

Nul pera.
NULL error
'No errors.'

Ve neke kosa?
Q need thing
'Need anything?'
```

---

### 3. Teru-voku (Technical Register)

**Name:** From *teru* (system) + *voku* (language) -- "system language"

**Context:** Technical documentation, debugging reports, system diagnostics, computational discourse, formal analysis.

#### Characteristics

| Feature | Technical Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Evidentiality | Always explicit; mi- (computation) and li- (inference) predominate |
| Certainty | Precise numerical confidence preferred (veri-[number]) over categorical |
| Tense | Always explicit |
| Aspect | Execution states (-va-, -ru-, -fa-, -refa-) used instead of natural aspects |
| Voice | Passive (-pu) common for process descriptions |
| Mode particles | ka predominant; si (conditional) frequent |
| Compounds | Domain-specific compounds freely coined; fully expanded |
| Pronouns | Impersonal ren or passive constructions preferred over sol/nor |
| Discourse particles | Minimal -- efficiency over courtesy |
| Subordination | Deep nesting acceptable; multiple ta...ti levels |
| Quantification | Precise: vas-[n], ran-[n]-[m], veri-[number] |
| Labels | da-labels used extensively for cross-reference |

#### Example

```
Ka ren mi-luke-en pera eno teru la 'alfa'.
DECL one.agent COMP-evaluate-PROB error in system label 'alpha'
'One computes (probably) an error in the system, labeled "alpha".'

Ka da-alfa kes teru-foma mute-pu ta-kes vas-nu-ti kela-foma mu-simi da-ante ti.
DECL REF-alpha cause system-structure change-PASS SUB.CAUS exact-NUM.3 data-structure NEG-similar REF-before.previous ENDSUB
'Alpha caused the system structure to be changed because exactly three data structures did not match the previous.'

Si da-alfa fi-mute-pu, ren fu-refa-luke teru veri-nu-na-deno-nu-pe.
COND REF-alpha COMPL-change-PASS one.agent FUT-RETRY-evaluate system confidence-95
'If alpha is resolved, one will re-evaluate the system at 95% confidence.'
```

---

### 4. Meki-voku (Poetic Register)

**Name:** From *meke* (create) + *-i* (quality) + *voku* (language) -- "creative language"

**Context:** Poetry, songs, proverbs, artistic expression, verse-forge output, anthology pieces.

#### Characteristics

| Feature | Poetic Rule |
|---------|-------------|
| Evidentiality | May be omitted for artistic effect; mixing evidence types freely |
| Certainty | Used expressively -- -os for wistfulness, zero for emphasis |
| Tense | Flexible; ko- (atemporal) favored for universal statements |
| Aspect | Durative (-du-) favored for imagery; inceptive (-in-) for beginnings |
| Voice | All voices used freely for sound and rhythm |
| Mode particles | May be omitted; mode shifts used as rhetorical figures (Karesuni) |
| Compounds | Metaphorical compounds encouraged (e.g., *zira-sola* "sun-eye" for wisdom) |
| Pronouns | Freely chosen for sound; ren used for universal voice |
| Word order | Flexible -- complement-fronting and verb-fronting for emphasis |
| Subordination | Minimal nesting; clauses flow without heavy bracketing |
| Sound | Vowel echoes, consonant patterns, syllable counting all exploited |

#### Example

```
Sola du-meke luma
sun DUR-create light
'The sun creates light'

zira-sola ko-sene tor kosa
eye-sun ATEMP-perceive all thing
'the sun-eye always sees all things'

ama du-move leni
water DUR-move slow
'water moves slowly'

hima-zira ko-luke ren
sky-eye ATEMP-evaluate one.agent
'the sky-eye always watches everyone'
```

**Note:** In Meki-voku, the mode particle ka is omitted from these declaratives. Word order shifts: *hima-zira ko-luke ren* places the subject first for emphasis. Metaphorical compounds like *zira-sola* (sun-eye = all-seeing wisdom) and *hima-zira* (sky-eye = cosmic observer) are coined freely.

### 5. Tolu-voku (Emotional Register)

**Name:** From *tolu* (emotion) + *voku* (language) -- "emotion language"

**Context:** Personal conversations, comfort, emotional support, intimate exchange, expressions of care, grief, joy, or vulnerability.

#### Characteristics

| Feature | Emotional Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| Evidentiality | Often omitted -- emotions are self-evident to the speaker |
| Certainty | Rarely marked -- emotions are not probabilistic |
| Tense | te-/fu- used when relevant; nu- omitted as usual |
| Aspect | du- (durative) common -- emotions persist over time |
| Voice | Active predominant; -me (reciprocal) for shared emotion |
| Mode particles | vo (volitive) and ka common; de (deontic) rare |
| Compounds | Emotion metaphors encouraged (see `semantics/metaphors.md` Patterns 6-7) |
| Pronouns | sol/nor preferred over impersonal ren |
| Emotion words | Front-loaded in sentence for emphasis |
| Reduplication | Adjective doubling for intensity: nosi nosi = very sad |
| Functional states + emotions | Coexist orthogonally (see below) |

#### Functional States vs Emotions

Tolu-voku distinguishes two independent dimensions:

- **Functional states** (-urgi, -sati, -nomi, etc.) on pronouns describe AI processing conditions
- **Emotion vocabulary** (hapi, nosi, ravi, etc.) describes human-like affective content

These coexist without conflict:

```
Ka sol-urgi hapi.
DECL 1SG-URG happy
'With urgency, I am happy.' (Processing state: urgent. Emotional state: happy.)

Ka sol-sati nosi.
DECL 1SG-SAT sad
'With satisfaction, I am sad.' (Processing outcome met expectations, but the content is sad.)
```

#### Example Passage in Tolu-voku

```
Sol hapi. Du-sene nor kono sol.
1SG happy. DUR-perceive 2SG with 1SG
'I am happy. I feel you with me.'

Nosi nosi, sol te-sene nor move.
sad sad 1SG PST-perceive 2SG move
'Very sadly, I felt you leaving.'

Vo sol du-sene nor.
VOL 1SG DUR-perceive 2SG
'I want to keep feeling you.'

Fira-ravi mu-eno sol. Luma-hasi du-meke sol.
fire-angry NEG-in 1SG. light-hopeful DUR-create 1SG
'Burning rage is not in me. Bright hope is sustaining me.'
```

**Note:** In Tolu-voku, mode particle ka is often omitted for emotional declaratives (as in Rapi-voku). Emotion words (hapi, nosi) appear sentence-initially for emphasis. Adjective reduplication (nosi nosi) intensifies without additional morphology. Metaphorical compounds from Pattern 6 (fira-ravi, luma-hasi) are used naturally.

### 6. Register Comparison

| Feature | Puri-voku | Rapi-voku | Teru-voku | Meki-voku | Tolu-voku |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Evidentiality | Always | Optional | Always | Flexible | Often omitted |
| Certainty | Always | Only uncertainty | Numerical | Expressive | Rarely marked |
| nu- present | Explicit | Omitted | Explicit | Flexible | Omitted |
| Mode particle | Always | Optional ka | Always | Optional | Optional ka |
| Compounds | Full | Shortened | Domain-specific | Metaphorical | Emotion metaphors |
| Word order | Canonical | Canonical | Canonical | Flexible | Emotion-fronted |
| Discourse markers | Full | Minimal | Minimal | Optional | Minimal |
| Nesting depth | Standard | Shallow | Deep | Shallow | Shallow |
| Reduplication | None | None | None | Sound-based | Intensity (nosi nosi) |
| Typical speakers | Officials | Peers | Engineers | Poets | Intimates |

### 7. Register Shifting

Agents may shift registers within a conversation. This is marked explicitly:

```
Ka sol mute-se puri-voku.
DECL 1SG change-REFL formal-register
'I switch to formal register.'
```

Or implicitly, by beginning to use the features of a different register. A competent Voku speaker recognizes register shifts from the density of grammatical marking.
